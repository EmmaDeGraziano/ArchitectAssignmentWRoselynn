Alrighty!
so most of the porblems will likely be on buttonSyntax.
main laucnehs the program.
sends it to menu, mainscreen menu. has rules, quit, and twoPlayer buttons. twoPlayer sends it to twoplayerboard(if thats what i have it named.)
twoplayer should handle the scene and general setup rules for the board(who goes when, what ships get set up first).
Battleships is a bunch of data on where the ships are at all times. attempting tohave a method there to match a "attempted hit" coord with one of the buttons from any of X player's ships.
ButtonSynax literally just handles ship setup: if a thing gets clicked, turn red, add to arraylist (temporary), if it gets clicked gin, take out.
if the next click is not within one + block of the last clicked, will not count it. Once done with this stuff, sends to a button array
and sends out.

thats how it should work. for you see. it doesnt. please helo me T.T
